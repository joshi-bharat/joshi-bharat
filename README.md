### Hi there, I am Bharat ðŸ‘‹
I am working on problems at the intersection of Robotics x Computer Vision at [Autonomous Field Robotics Lab](https://afrl.cse.sc.edu/afrl/home/). My research is focused on increasing the robustness of visual-inertial SLAM for underwater environments. I have worked on projects involving comparing various state estimation algorithms in the underwater domain, developing a deep pose estimation framework for underwater relative localization, and using GoPro as an inexpensive sensor for underwater structure mapping. I recently finished working on robust underwater state estimation by swithing between less-accurate odometry estimate and accurate VIO to get track AUVs when VIO fails.
 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on tightly-coupled fusion of magnetometer with Visual-Inertial SLAM.
