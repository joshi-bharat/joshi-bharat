### Hi there, I am Bharat ðŸ‘‹
I am a Computer Vision Engineer at [Dexterity](https://www.dexterity.ai/) working on problems at the intersection of Robotics x Computer Vision. At dexterity, we are developing autonomous truck loading robots leveraging AI and Computer Vision. Previously, I completed my PhD from University of South Carolina at [Autonomous Field Robotics Lab](https://afrl.cse.sc.edu/afrl/home/). My research was focused on increasing the robustness of visual-inertial SLAM for underwater environments. I have worked on projects involving comparing various state estimation algorithms in the underwater domain, developing a deep pose estimation framework for underwater relative localization, and using GoPro as an inexpensive sensor for underwater structure mapping. We recently presented a paper on tightly-coupled fusion of magnetometer with Visual-Inertial SLAM at ICRA 2024.
